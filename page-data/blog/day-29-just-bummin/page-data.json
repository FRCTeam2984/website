The hustle and bustle just seems to drone on as everything fits into place. It's really weird because everyone is doing their jobs and there is like this understanding setting in that we need to get this done. Whether you think that's good or quiet doesn't matter as since the previous leader of Communications is helping the drive team, I am now the highest ranking person in the wing. It's lonely at the top boys and girls. I love you all.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/20180208/me.JPG\" alt=\"Hey look it&#x27;s me\"></p>\n<p>Mechanical is working on making parts for the arm and other miscellaneous pieces for the robot.

In other words, we're the backbone of the team. And now with me as temporary leader, i'll shape this team into greatness.</p>\n<p>The mood is hopeful yet pragmatic</p>\n<p>\"Thiccbot makes me feel self-conscious\" -Anonymous</p>\n<p>With love,\nMarshall</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/day-29-just-bummin","title":"Day 29 - Just Bummin' Around"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
