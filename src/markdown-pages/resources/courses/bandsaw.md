In this lesson we will be covering just how to use the Bandsaw. From cutting long pieces of wood, to handfeeding a piece of metal, you can expect to be using this delightful piece of machinery throughout most of the season! There will be a video tutorial at the bottom of each of when the lessons are done.

This is what the video should have:

- 1 How to turn on/off the Bandsaw
- 2 How to place a piece of metal into the vice
- 3 Mention how heavy the top part of the Bandsaw is (Hint:It really isn't)
- 4 Mention when cutting on should keep slight pressure on the top of the Bandsaw
- 5 Continuously apply oil when cutting
- 6 Keep both sides of the metal supported throughout the process
