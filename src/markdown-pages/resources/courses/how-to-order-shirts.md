Ordering the shirts will require time and effort. The people who start this process should be the same people who end this process.

1. Create design

- Announce that there will be shirts (At a Meeting and through Email)
- Estimate how much each shirt will cost. Ask people at a Saturday meeting if they will buy a shirt. Estimate a price using https://www.customink.com/quotes
- Announce the estimated shirt price
- Ask everyone the following. What Type: Hoodie/Shirt. What Size: S/M/L/XL. to give you the money in cash
- Record who gave you the money (Print out the sheet with all the info of who bought a shirt)
- Give Dana Irwin the money. Order the shirts with Dana Irwin
- Bring the box of shirts to Robotics and distribute the shirts

**SIDE NOTES**

- Mentors get free shirts

- Order them at least 2 weeks before Season so you can have them on Kickoff

- Make the announced price a little higher than the quote because people will change their mind

- The money gathering will take a while make it easy

- Make sure somebody can keep the box at their house/office for a few days
