Now as the rain pours I must listen as theater trains outside and I sit hungry without my burrito become someone stole it! Someone (Aaron G.) is now not allowed to be my friend anymore, he's also uninvited to my birthday party. and as the tone around the table is nothing new and just seeing what we can do today in preparation for the large Saturday tomorrow. if you want to know what the team is doing pretty much what we did yesterday, but with more of a joking and lighthearted mood. everyone is happy and you can see so in the pictures down below:
