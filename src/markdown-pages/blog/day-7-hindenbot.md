Wrapping up from a week of working, we see what we have accomplished.

We now have a solid program for making a robot move when using a controller, a solid chassis for the robot as well as an plate full of electronics to allow the chassis to run.

The Communications has began to work directly on the website and posting a gantt chart in the room.

Logistics has learned about the teams budget and how to make transactions.

The team is optimistic and is on track to win this year.

The mood is hindenbot.
