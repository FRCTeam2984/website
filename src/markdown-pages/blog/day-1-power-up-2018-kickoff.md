The game consists of trying to place blocks on switches to tip it in your favor. Basically more cubes means more points.

 The competition also has a raised scale which is in the middle of the field which is 5 feet off the ground almost as tall as a human being!

The team can also trade in cubes for "power ups" that benefit the team such as getting double points or gaining control of the switch or scale.

Each team has "portals" on opposing sides of the field allowing human players to feed cubes to the robot.

All in all there is more than 50 cubes that can be on the field at once each 13 inches.

At the end of the game the robots get a chance to climb up the scale and need to be 12 inches off the ground to score points.

The objective of the game is to get the most amount of points and win the match! This year there are a few ways to earn points and it's now up to our team to find out what way we want to get them!
