The map of the playing area  and archetypes for diagrams are up. Now we can refer to the place where we can filp the robot upside down.

Software is making their driving programs work better so they can pilot a test robot for later.

Mechanical added motors to the chassis and now we have a solid base to work with. Time to add all the fun stuff!

Communications finished learning html, css, and git.

Logistics was taught to set orders for different parts.

The mood is normal.
