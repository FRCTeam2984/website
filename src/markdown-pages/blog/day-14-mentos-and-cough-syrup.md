After a vigorous and passionate session of robotics I sit down and type out the blog to give everyone a little insight into what exactly we are doing today.

Communications being first because were the most superior, we are ordering stickers to have for the big competition (if you want them talk to Lukas), making and refining the team page for it to have more stuff that looks better and less stuff that does not. We're also trying to get quotes for pins in addition to stickers to spread our propaganda. The team has decided to take down our facebook in order to prioritize our website.

Mechanical is working with the intake system, Lily is mounting it onto the robot, Tabitha is testing the robot and the mechanism to see if everything works, and if it doesn't they refine it and make it work. Bohan is busy making another intake machine to be tested at a later date.

Electrical and software are just tuning the drive control for the robot and and creating a new controller for the motor controller (meaning were using a video game controller to move a Freaking robot).
