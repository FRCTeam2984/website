As the music gets worse and the food gets more plentiful as we stock up and set in, we all come to the realization that like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, we need more friends. The team has elected Blocky (My son now) as our inspiration in these trying times. we now follow his adventures:

Electrical is still working on autonomous path calibration and seeing if they can make both robots follow the same path together. we see here as Jr. follows the nerds around in their endeavors.

Mechanical is busy still finishing prototypes for the robot, to make sure it can grab things properly. the mechanical team tried to steal my son but we got him back. Aden is personally seeing to installing a status light holder for the robot.

And finally we have Communications, the ones playing all the bad music and eating all the good snacks as we type and program and really hold up the backbone of this team but we cant really tell them that. Logistics is getting rid of budget anomalies and chilling out with us. productivity is at a maximum. (you can see me right next to my son in the Grey shirt!)

The mood is finals.
