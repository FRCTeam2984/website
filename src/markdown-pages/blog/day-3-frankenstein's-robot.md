The work continues as software troubleshoots getting the Roborio to work with the robot. Once they get it working the robot will BE ALIVE!!!! ALIVE!!!!!

Mechanical is happy to begin designing field elements after being cooped up in the room. Plans are being laid out for future development as we read.

Communications is learning HTML to help code the website and make sure it stays up to par and Logistics continues to create a budget.
