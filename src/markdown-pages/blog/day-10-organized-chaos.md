The Labor continues on till the shadows lengthen and the moon rises, we are the robotics team and we do not stop until we're done, or our moms come to pick us up because its dinner time.

Mechanical started developing a forklift for the robot, while another division is working on a pull intake system, dubbed "the Garbage Machine".

Here we see a wild Bohan working on his grand contraption.

Electrical is making autonomous route following easier for the robot, while also calibrating drive encoders for the betterment of the robot.

Communications is busy learning how to push the blog up by themselves (Me), taking pictures for the team, and adding logos of our sponsors to the website (we owe everything to them).

Logistics is busy closing a 15 dollar gap in the account, working on the account, and general organization.

The mood is doing anything once.
