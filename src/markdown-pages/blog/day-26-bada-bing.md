Hello lovies, I am back from the edge of nowhere. I am here to keep you informed and to keep you hopefully happy (although thats not definite,however I guess the first one isn't either however it is much harder to mess up)

Electronics is busy updating the firmware for the Roborio, and updating the cable equipment to make sure its as optimal as possible.

Mechanical is prototyping a mock-up of the intake, finalizing the design in the robot and mounting the systems to make sure it actually works.

Communications is finalizing the groups for the Google, and stylizin' the website so it looks the same. Logistics is busy just working on anomalies again, so nothing much has changed.

The mood is Jazz hands covered in molasses.
