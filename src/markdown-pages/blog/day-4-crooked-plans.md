Software got the old robot running! Make sure you wear shinguards...

They also ended up fixing the roborio.

Mechanical built the exchange, tried to build a switch but it ended up crooked due to some conflicts in planning. I wonder whose fault that was...

Communications learned the basics of github and ugh...more html and css. Logistics learned how to add items to the budget.

The mood is expectant.
