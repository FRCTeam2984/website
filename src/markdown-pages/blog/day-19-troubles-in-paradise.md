 I don't have much time, i need to write this before they come to get me. I am the last Survivor. Everyone else has changed. Ever since Tanvir left, I've become king of Communications and taken on a Queen of a certain Dominique Hartman, but some insurgent cells aren't too keen on me having that much power, just a blogger from rags to riches. I AM THE LORD. NONE GO AGAINST MY IRON RULE! SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS.

 Logistics is organizing sponsors for the team, as in making sure everyone gets represented. Communications is making the understanding of CSS even more prevalent and making the website look good. Specifically changing the colors and making it look more A E S T H E T I C. I'm busy writing the blog and making the information readable for next years people.

 Mechanical is making one extra intake so electronics and drive team can both have one. They're also working on calculating necessary measurements for the Mechanisms to fit into the guidelines of the competition.

 Electronics is developing arm control so they can make the intake arms operate at optimal performance. With that, LED lights that light up when they grab something and the sensors that know when to light up when they sense it. The nerds are also working on making the robot follow autonomous paths to the scale, being able to mirror that command to the other side of the competition. so effectively just more nerd things.
