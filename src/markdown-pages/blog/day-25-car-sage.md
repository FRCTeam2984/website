Again he is gone. The spoon to my fork, the ford to my river, the grape to my stem...Marshall...I have yet to see him today and I fear that he will not be with us this day.

But besides that looks like we are getting back on track schedule.

Mechanical is engulfing members of Electrical like a man in the Sahara drinks water, frantically and without regard for anything else.

Mechanical is split into two groups one is focusing on building the intake while the hodgepodge of Electrical and Mechanical members continues to finish the wide Chassis. We have plans to finish both projects by the end of the day. They are also focusing on trying to finalizing the plans for Sorcerer (The Scale Mechanism) as well as eating more junk food.

Aden has retreated to his car and has now become Car Sage.

Drive Team and I have teamed up and I have been recording times for the obstacle courses she completes. It gives a bit of direction to her driving which is a welcome to her kitbot without an arm. But not to worry that will soon change.

Communications is creating the Google Group for the Robotics to allow for discussion outside of Robotics. We are also working on funding pitches to Pete's On Pearl (*Fingers Crossed*) as well as implementing Atom Feed and stylizing the website.

I believe this model of the field is a cool representation of the field...Tabitha thinks so too.

Electrical has its work cut out for itself they are going to have to get all the electrical equipment on the new chassis and the battery mount so we can have a drivable chassis for Monday.

I'm not the only one interested in taking pictures

The mood is frantic and stressful.
